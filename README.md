# Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-LSTM
This project generates natural language descriptions (captions) for input images using a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence generation.

We use the Xception model for feature extraction and train an LSTM-based decoder to learn contextual language patterns to describe the image meaningfully.
