# Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-LSTM
This project generates captions for input images using a combination of CNN for image feature extraction and LSTM network for sequence generation.

We use the Xception model for feature extraction and train an LSTM-based decoder to learn contextual language patterns to describe the image meaningfully.
